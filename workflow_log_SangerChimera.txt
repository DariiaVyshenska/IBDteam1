# nsdl 4.24.18

# Purpose: identify chimeric sequences and eventually remove them
# Goal: prepare sequences for further analysis

# Step 1: download database for 16S sequences (this is in my personal directory but I will move to shared folder
# SILVA_132_SSURef_Nr99_tax_silva.fasta

# Step 2: create .txt with uchime commands
# findChimeraMulti.txt

# Step 3: run uchime to identify these sequences
SGE_Array -c findChimeraMulti.txt -r uchimeBatch -P 1 -m 4G -b 23

# nsdl 5.2.18

# Step 4: search uchime files for the identified chimeras and print those to a file
grep ' *Y$' -r uchimeResults/ > chimeras.txt

# Step 5: parse this list for just the Sequence IDs using python
python2.7 parseUchime.py
