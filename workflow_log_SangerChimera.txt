# Purpose: identify chimeric sequences and eventually remove them
# Goal: prepare sequences for further analysis

# Step 1: download database for 16S sequences (this is in my personal directory but I will move to shared folder
# SILVA_132_SSURef_Nr99_tax_silva.fasta

# Step 2: create .txt with uchime commands
# findChimeraMulti.txt

# Step 3: run uchime to identify these sequences
SGE_Array -c findChimeraMulti.txt -r uchimeBatch -P 1 -m 4G -b 23
