# Purpose: remove primer and vector sequences from Sanger sequencing reads
# Goal: allow further processing on these files

# step 1: create reference fasta file containing primer and vector sequences to remove from reads

# step 2: write bbduk command to remove these sequences

# step 3: run bbduk

# step 4: check efficacy of primer and vector sequence removal
