# primers and barcodes were removed during demultiplexing, therefore the .fastq files do not contain primers and barcodes
# and are not trimmed in mothur workflow
# before running SGE_Batch, .fastq files were uncompressed using gunzip
# running mothur as SGE_Batch:
SGE_Batch -c 'mothur ibd.batch' -q all.q -r log_dir -P 24 -f 100G -m 100G -F 400G
